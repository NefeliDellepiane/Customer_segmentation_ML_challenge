# Customer segmentation ML challenge

This is a Machine Learning challenge that was completed during the Constructor-Learning Bootcamp.

We were given a dataset containing 8500 customers and 18 features characterising their credit card transactions over a six month timeline.

The goal was to perform a customer segmentation that could be utilised for the implementation of targeted marketing campaigns.  

The features were explained as follows:

    customer_id : id of the credit card holder

    balance_account : balance amount left in the account to make purchases at the end of the 6-month period

    purchases_amount : amount of purchases made from account

    paid_advance : number of transactions made with “Cash in Advance” method

    full_purchases : maximum purchase amount done in full payment

    balance_frequency_update : how frequently the balance has been updated, score between 0 and 1 (1 = frequently - updated, 0 = not frequently updated)

    installments : amount of purchases done in installments

    purchases_frequency : how frequently the purchases are being made, score between 0 and 1 (1 = frequently - - purchased, 0 = not frequently purchased)

    full_purchases_frequency : how frequently purchases are happening in full payment (1 = frequently purchased, - 0 = not frequently purchased)

    purchases_installments_frequency : how frequently purchases in installments are being done (1 = frequently - done, 0 = not frequently done)

    cash_advance_frequency : how frequently the cash in advance being paid

    nr_cash_advances : cash in advance given by the user

    nr_purchases : number of purchase transactions made

    credit_limit : limit of credit card for user

    fixed_rate_period : duration of fixed interest rate of credit card service for user (in months)

    payments : amount of payment done by user

    min_payments : minimum amount of payments made by user

    full_payment_prc : percent of full payment paid by user
